## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (recommended: use nvm)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Briefly
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

This will start both the Vite development server (React app) and Electron main process. The app will open automatically.

### Development Scripts

```bash
# Start development server (React + Electron)
npm run dev

# Build React app only
npm run build:vite

# Build Electron main process
npm run build:electron

# Build complete app for distribution
npm run build

# Run type checking
npm run type-check

# Run linting
npm run lint
```

```

### Component Architecture

The app follows a modular component architecture:

- **Layout Components**: Handle overall app structure and navigation
- **Feature Components**: Implement specific functionality (stories, reading, search)
- **Shared Components**: Reusable UI components and utilities
- **Hooks**: Encapsulate business logic and side effects

### State Management

- **Zustand**: Global app state (stories, filters, settings)
- **React Query**: Server state and caching

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### Supabase Setup

1. Create a new Supabase project
2. Set up the stories table with the following schema:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE stories (
     id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
     user_id uuid REFERENCES auth.users NOT NULL,
     publication_name text NOT NULL,
     title text NOT NULL,
     summary text,
     content text NOT NULL,
     importance_score integer DEFAULT 0,
     is_read boolean DEFAULT false,
     is_bookmarked boolean DEFAULT false,
     category text,
     read_time_minutes integer,
     source_url text,
     author text,
     published_at timestamp with time zone,
     created_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now(),
     updated_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now()
   );
   ```
