Project 3 Brainlift

Amazon Ops Dashboard - Discarded
Pull SP-API and re-create a more brand focused verticalized version of Seller Central. Pull data from tools everyone uses (Helium10, Repricer, Stock, etc) and allow you to have a one stop shop for tweaks. 

I think this is would be very useful but I don’t want to typecast myself with too many AMZ focused projects and also this is better as a website than a desktop tool

Computer Use tool for X - Discarded
Scroll through my feed and pick out posts I’m likely to find interesting. Filter out all political content,crypto spam, cat videos, etc. 

I think this would be fun but it’s also something I think a lot of people are working on, and feels just a touch too generic. Also I won’t have access to the X API so it’ll have to be through scraping my feed which doesn’t sound fun.

Briefly - Auto Summarize Newsletters + Youtube Videos

I subscribe to 100+ youtube channels, 80+ newsletters, and am a voracious reader of The Economist + Bloomberg Businessweek. The amount of content I consume has gotten overwhelming and I’ve been noticing myself reading fewer of my newsletters, watching fewer of my youtube subscriptions, and really only keeping up w/ Bloomberg + the Economist and X. 

My information diet used to be so clean and varied, and now I feel like I’m much more of a normie when it comes to which thoughts I let enter my brain. I want to fix this, and rather than pare down my subscriptions, I think using AI to summarize + highlight which items I should read on a daily basis would be really useful. Not only that, I can eventually incorporate anki style zettelkasten notes which I can use to test my retention on these topics as well. 

The reason I want this to be a desktop app is that I get a huge % of my reading done while on a plane (offline). I was traveling for work/fun a lot over the last few years and took 64 flights in 2023, and 54 in 2024 so this is a huge selling point for me and a constant source of frustration when I can’t access some of my newsletters (especially the images while reading them in offline mode in gmail). Not only that, gmail doesn’t remember which newsletters I read while on the plane and won’t mark them as read which also contributes to me not feeling like I’m making a dent into the number of newsletters I’ve finished. 

In short, I think this could be a really powerful app for me. 

Potential Hyper-Personalized Feature Expansions:
Newsletter Writers often have meetups that they’ll open to readers in some issues. Highlight those in case I want to attend
If any new product (tech, CPG, etc) gets mentioned, surface the option to let me buy it (or buy it automatically if it’s under a set $$ amount and is in my auto buy category (new food products!)
Spotify Wrapped for my info diet. Topics, amount of reading done, favorite authors, etc
Daily Priority Digest: A single daily view that ranks items using your interests, recency, author weight, topic diversity (e.g. avoid 10 crypto pieces in a row).
Topic Health + Diversity Meter: Show a dashboard of topic categories and how much time/attention you’ve allocated lately. Nudge you to rebalance when you’re overly focused on, say, finance over culture
Local Models for summarization/some tasks to ease cost burden
Collaborative info diet: Compare or share “info wraps” with friends (without oversharing content itself, just meta-insights)
